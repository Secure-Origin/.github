## Our Mission

We believe better defenses come from shared knowledge. Secure Origin produces high-quality, freely available security research and tools to help defenders protect modern infrastructure across Linux, Windows, and cloud environments.

### What We Build

- **Adversary Emulation** — Caldera abilities and ATT&CK-mapped attack plans for purple teaming
- **Detection Engineering** — Sigma, YARA, auditd, and eBPF rules with validation frameworks
- **Threat Intelligence** — STIX 2.1 feeds, IOC collections, and OCSF transformation libraries
- **Security Tools** — Open-source utilities for continuous threat exposure management

## Why Open Source?

Our research serves two purposes: sharing knowledge with the security community, and validating the methodologies behind our commercial platform. All projects are released freely under permissive licenses.

## About Secure Origin

While our research is platform-agnostic and free to use, it's informed by the real-world challenges we solve in our commercial CTEM platform. This ensures our open-source work is practical, tested, and production-ready.
